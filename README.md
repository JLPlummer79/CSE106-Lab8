# CSE106-Lab8
Lab 8 Group Project

Basis is from Lab 7; index needs to be changed to the login page, then make the landing page index.
Index will need a navigation bar and branch out the different pieces as different websites, nav bar will connect all of them.

More to come.

To Do: rough sketches
1) Alter db / table to meet requreiments (teacher/student roles, emails, passwords...)
2) Add Navigation Bar to overall code (is in a tutorial that is pretty reasonable to follow) alter as we wish to meet our wants/needs
3) Add more forms/pages to meet requirements of Lab/Project
4) Base code has very little CSS could use some.. but I don't really care if it works
Add more as needed.
